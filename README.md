# Frozen-Sea

Frozen-Sea is a website designated to create, manage and participate in user-studies at Ludwig-Maximilians University Munich. The website was designed and built during the "Practical Course Web Development" at Ludwig-Maximilians University Munich.

# Frameworks and Tools
The project REST-API is generated by [LoopBack](http://loopback.io).
The frontend was built in [angular.js](https://angularjs.org) with the use of [Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org).
We use [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) with [mLab](https://mlab.com) as database.

# Deployment
When deploying the project to a new server you need to follow these steps:
1) Install node and npm.  
2) Perform "npm install" in the parent directory as well as in the "client" directory.  
3) If "bower install" is not performed automatically by "npm install" you need to perform this command in both folders too.  
4) Change the API URL in the client/app/app.config.js inside LoopBackResourceProvider.setUrlBase('http://localhost:3000/api') to the the new API URL.  

# Changing the datasource
1) You need to change the \server\datasources.json file to point to the new database.  
2) You need to create (e.g. copy) the following roles in the database, inside a collection named "Role":   

{
    "_id": {
        "$oid": "58bc4281b4660d0d66daeb90"
    },
    "name": "advisor",
    "created": {
        "$date": "2017-03-05T16:53:21.425Z"
    },
    "modified": {
        "$date": "2017-03-05T16:53:21.425Z"
    }
}
  
AND  

{
    "_id": {
        "$oid": "58bc42e50435dc1f661f62ec"
    },
    "name": "admin",
    "created": {
        "$date": "2017-03-05T16:55:00.962Z"
    },
    "modified": {
        "$date": "2017-03-05T16:55:00.962Z"
    }
}  

3) You need at least one admin account. First register a new account and then create a collection named "RoleMapping". Elevate the account to admin by adding

{
    "_id": {
        "$oid": "58c89db9bdc0119431742940"
    },
    "principalType": "USER",
    "principalId": "58b5be7e6efdc2e829839ac5",
    "roleId": {
        "$oid": "58bc42e50435dc1f661f62ec"
    }
}  

where principalId is the id of your new admin account, roldeId is the id of the role and id is a random new id for the RoleMapping instance.  
The calculation of experiment hours is tied to the Subuser, Preference and Participation objects, so all three need to be migrated if no experiment hours should be lost.
 
# Changing the website email-adresss
You need to change the \server\datasources.json file to point to the new email account.
Additionally you need to change all mentions of the old email in all the localization files. Best you perform a complete replace-all refactor over the whole project.

# API Reference
A complete API Reference is provided by navigating to https://#path-to-website#/explorer
To do so, you first you need to change \server\component-config.json from  
{
  "loopback-component-explorer": null
}  

to  
{
  "loopback-component-explorer": {
    "mountPath": "/explorer"
  }
}  
For retrieving experiment hours of students, call https://#path-to-api#/getVPSFrom(matrikelnummer).  

In the original version #path-to-website# resolves to https://frozen-sea.herokuapp.com and #path-to-api# to https://frozen-sea.herokuapp.com/api.
